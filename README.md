Uses java to evaluate how good a 'mod' combination is for all possible combinations in Warframe.

Recursively generates all of the combinations in Integer format and then converts all of that to mods based on input files. I made this like a year ago so breaking it down into these less efficient steps made it easier to comprehend, but if I ever revisit I'll probably make it more efficient.

Currently only has one evaluation class for 'Xaku' and is probably outdated as far as the inputs are concerned, but has been configured for simple expansion if I wanted more from it.
